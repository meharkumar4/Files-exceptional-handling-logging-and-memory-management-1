        "- Memory management is crucial in Python because it ensures efficient use of system resources, preventing memory leaks and performance degradation. Python's built-in memory management system automatically allocates and deallocates memory, reducing the risk of manual errors. Features like **reference counting**, **garbage collection**, and **dynamic memory allocation** help optimize memory usage, especially in applications handling large datasets, complex computations, or real-time processing. Efficient memory management enhances application speed, scalability, and stability, making programs run smoothly without excessive memory consumption. Understanding and applying memory optimization techniques, such as using generators, deleting unnecessary objects, and managing references properly, helps improve performance and resource utilization in Python applications.\n",

        "15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by identifying and reclaiming unused objects, preventing memory leaks and optimizing performance. It primarily relies on **reference counting**, where each object has a reference count that increases when assigned to a variable and decreases when references are removed. When the count reaches zero, the object is automatically deleted. However, reference cycles (where objects reference each other) can cause memory issues, which is why Python also includes a **cyclic garbage collector** within the `gc` module. This collector periodically scans and removes objects involved in circular references. Developers can manually trigger garbage collection using `gc.collect()`, but Python generally handles memory cleanup efficiently in the background.\n",

To raise an exception, specify the exception type followed by an optional error message. For example, `raise ValueError(\"Invalid input!\")` will immediately stop execution and display the given error message. You can also raise built-in exceptions like `TypeError`, `IndexError`, or define custom exceptions using a class that inherits from `Exception`.
